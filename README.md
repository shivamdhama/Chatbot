# Chatbot
In this project I have made a chatbot using Sequence 2 Sequence model (LSTM).
I have used Encoder and Decoder approach for this.
Chatbot predict pretty good answers.
Technology used:
 Language: Python 3.6 
 Lib: Keras
 Algorithms: LSTM
 Model: Sequence 2 Sequence.
Loss: .0431 
Data Source: kaggle
Further improvement is going on!
